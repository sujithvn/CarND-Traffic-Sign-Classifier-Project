## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This project is submitted as part of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree program.

Please refer the [Write-Up](writeup.md) for the submission check points and the responses/findings.

The code is available both in [Notebook](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) and [HTML](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html) format.



In this project, we use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that we find on the web.



The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Pre-process the data including Augmentation.
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
